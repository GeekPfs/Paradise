# Paradise

[Paradise](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/paradise) plays like a strange [interactive fiction novel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gmMVjHJ6cU), in an ever-changing world where you are not an avatar but a force acting upon places, and objects, and puns, words - moving around and into your other selves, threading through chaos.

_“I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.”_ — Jorge Luis Borges
